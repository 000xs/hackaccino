## How did you build this?

How: After researching the different code statements that can be used with Aframe (such as declaring a shape and its characteristics like position, color, etc.), I modeled a house that I wanted to digitize; I then created the necessary dimensions for specific geometric shapes I could use to build the house. This ended up being multiple planes, triangles, and a box, each with their own characteristics to create the house.
